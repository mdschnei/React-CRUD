## Available Scripts

To test the project, run both of the following in the project directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `json-server --watch src/contacts.json --port 3002`

Runs the json-server package and opens the server at port 3002. 
Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view it in your browser.

[http://localhost:3002/contacts](http://localhost:3002/contacts) will show the current list of contacts, while appending /:id to the end of the URL will show the contact information for a specified ID, for example [http://localhost:3002/contacts/1](http://localhost:3002/contacts/1).
